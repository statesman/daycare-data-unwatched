I observed a child filling a plastic ziploc bag with water from the water fountain, water puddling onto the floor, and then the child drinking out of that plastic bag.  Outside, I observed the child playing on the climbing structure and slide with the same ziploc bag that still had some water inside and after I asked the caregiver about this, she addressed it and took the bag from the child.  Outside, I observed children hanging from the outside of the first turn of the slide and dropping down to the ground.  Outside, I observed two children climbing up the outside of the climber on the climbing structure.  During the inspection, I had to step in to redirect two children to prevent a fight and possible injury.    I observed two children playing tug of war with a bulletin board border strip on the stairs of the stage and this was corrected by caregivers after a several minutes as I was going over to the children.
